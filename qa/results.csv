5,"If a train leaves at 3 PM traveling 60 mph and another at 4 PM going 80 mph, when do they meet?",6 PM,"A classic problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train leaves at 3 PM and travels at 60 mph.
2. The second train leaves at 4 PM (1 hour later) and travels at 80 mph.

To find the time when they meet, we need to calculate how far apart they are at each minute after 4 PM.

At 4:00 PM, the first train has been traveling for 1 hour, so it's 60 miles ahead of the starting point. The second train is still at the starting point.

At 4:01 PM, the first train has traveled an additional 0.5 miles (since it's going 60 mph), making a total distance of 60.5 miles from the starting point. The second train has also moved 1 mile in that minute (since it's going 80 mph).

We can continue this process:

4:02 PM: First train is now 61 miles ahead, while the second train is 2 miles ahead.
4:03 PM: First train is now 61.5 miles ahead, while the second train is 3 miles ahead.
...
4:30 PM: First train is now 75 miles ahead, while the second train is 25 miles behind.

As you can see, the distance between them keeps decreasing until they finally meet at:

4:45 PM!

That's when the two trains will be exactly 15 miles apart, with the first train still going strong and the second train closing in.","A classic problem!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train leaves at 3 PM and travels at 60 mph.
2. The second train leaves at 4 PM (one hour later) and travels at 80 mph.

To find the time when they meet, we need to find the distance between them when they leave and then calculate how long it takes for the faster train to cover that distance.

Distance = Speed × Time

The first train travels for 1 hour before the second train leaves. So, it covers a distance of:

Distance = 60 mph × 1 hour = 60 miles

Now, we need to find out when the faster train (80 mph) catches up with the first train's position.

Time = Distance / Speed
= 60 miles / (80 mph - 60 mph)
= 2 hours

So, the second train takes 2 hours to cover the distance between them. Since it leaves at 4 PM, it will catch up with the first train at:

Meeting time = 4 PM + 2 hours = 6 PM

Therefore, the two trains meet at 6 PM.",not matched,matched
6,A store sells pencils at 3 for $1. How many can you buy with $5?,15,"Since the store sells pencils at 3 for $1, that means each pencil costs:

$1 ÷ 3 = $0.33 per pencil

To find out how many pencils you can buy with $5, multiply the cost of one pencil by 5:

$0.33 per pencil × 15 = 5 pencils

So, you can buy 5 pencils with $5!","Since the store sells pencils at 3 for $1, that means each pencil costs $1/3.

To find out how many pencils you can buy with $5, you can divide the amount of money you have ($5) by the cost of one pencil ($1/3):

$5 ÷ ($1/3) = $15

So, you can buy 15 pencils with $5!",matched,matched

11,"If today is Monday, what day of the week will it be 100 days from now?",Wednesday,"Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 100 by 7 to find the remainder:

So, 100 days from now will be 14 weeks and 2 days later. Therefore, it will be a Sunday.","Since there are 7 days in a week, you can divide 100 by 7 to find the remainder. This will tell you how many ""extra"" days there are.
