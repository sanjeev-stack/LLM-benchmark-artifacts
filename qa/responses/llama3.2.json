    "question": "If a train leaves at 3 PM traveling 60 mph and another at 4 PM going 80 mph, when do they meet?",
    "expected_answer": "6 PM",
    "model_response": "A classic problem!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first train leaves at 3 PM and travels at 60 mph.\n2. The second train leaves at 4 PM (one hour later) and travels at 80 mph.\n\nTo find the time when they meet, we need to find the distance between them when they leave and then calculate how long it takes for the faster train to cover that distance.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nThe first train travels for 1 hour before the second train leaves. So, it covers a distance of:\n\nDistance = 60 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 60 miles\n\nNow, we need to find out when the faster train (80 mph) catches up with the first train's position.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 60 miles / (80 mph - 60 mph)\n= 2 hours\n\nSo, the second train takes 2 hours to cover the distance between them. Since it leaves at 4 PM, it will catch up with the first train at:\n\nMeeting time = 4 PM + 2 hours = 6 PM\n\nTherefore, the two trains meet at 6 PM."

    "expected_answer": "15",
    "model_response": "Since the store sells pencils at 3 for $1, that means each pencil costs $1/3.\n\nTo find out how many pencils you can buy with $5, you can divide the amount of money you have ($5) by the cost of one pencil ($1/3):\n\n$5 \u00f7 ($1/3) = $15\n\nSo, you can buy 15 pencils with $5!"
