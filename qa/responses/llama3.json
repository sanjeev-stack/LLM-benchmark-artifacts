    "question": "If a train leaves at 3 PM traveling 60 mph and another at 4 PM going 80 mph, when do they meet?",
    "expected_answer": "6 PM",
    "model_response": "A classic problem!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first train leaves at 3 PM and travels at 60 mph.\n2. The second train leaves at 4 PM (1 hour later) and travels at 80 mph.\n\nTo find the time when they meet, we need to calculate how far apart they are at each minute after 4 PM.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, the first train has been traveling for 1 hour, so it's 60 miles ahead of the starting point. The second train is still at the starting point.\n\nAt 4:01 PM, the first train has traveled an additional 0.5 miles (since it's going 60 mph), making a total distance of 60.5 miles from the starting point. The second train has also moved 1 mile in that minute (since it's going 80 mph).\n\nWe can continue this process:\n\n4:02 PM: First train is now 61 miles ahead, while the second train is 2 miles ahead.\n4:03 PM: First train is now 61.5 miles ahead, while the second train is 3 miles ahead.\n...\n4:30 PM: First train is now 75 miles ahead, while the second train is 25 miles behind.\n\nAs you can see, the distance between them keeps decreasing until they finally meet at:\n\n4:45 PM!\n\nThat's when the two trains will be exactly 15 miles apart, with the first train still going strong and the second train closing in."

    "expected_answer": "15",
    "model_response": "Since the store sells pencils at 3 for $1, that means each pencil costs:\n\n$1 \u00f7 3 = $0.33 per pencil\n\nTo find out how many pencils you can buy with $5, multiply the cost of one pencil by 5:\n\n$0.33 per pencil \u00d7 15 = 5 pencils\n\nSo, you can buy 5 pencils with $5!"
